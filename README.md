# Electric Vehicle Range Prediction

A predictive model for estimating the range of electric vehicles based on various attributes.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the range of electric vehicles using a machine learning approach. The core functionality revolves around analyzing vehicle attributes such as acceleration, top speed, efficiency, and charging capabilities to estimate the maximum range. The solution is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, making it easy to explore, visualize, and model the data.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Load and preprocess electric vehicle data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create and select relevant features for model training.
- **Model Training:** Implement and train regression models to predict vehicle range.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters for better performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for data analysis and modeling.
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization.
  - `sklearn` for preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

### 📦 Installation

To set up the project locally:

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook installed
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

#### Running Locally

1. Open the Jupyter notebook in your local environment.
2. Run each cell sequentially to load data, preprocess, train the model, and evaluate performance.

### 💻 Usage

The notebook is structured to guide you through the entire process:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads the dataset and displays initial rows.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizes distributions and correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Selects and creates relevant features.
5. **Model Training:** Trains regression models and tunes hyperparameters.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance with metrics.
